# What is NHS login?

NHS login is a new way for people to prove who they are online, so they can access online health and care services safely and securely.

By integrating NHS login to your website or app you can offer users self-service access. You can also choose the level and combination of verification and authentication required for user access.

NHS login is based on [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/faq/) (OIDC). You can find out more about NHS login on the NHS Digital [website](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login)

## Before you start writing

1. Make sure before you begin writing your document, that you copy and paste the following block of text to the very top of your document
2. Make sure that where it states **"Your title"**, you change it to whatever you would like your title to be

```
---
layout: base.njk
title: Your title
---

```

Making sure your document contains this at the very top means that your contribution will automatically use the site theme.
