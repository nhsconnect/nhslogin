title: Testing scenarios
---
The following testing scenarios should be used as part of the [technical integration](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login/nhs-login-for-partners-and-developers/nhs-login-integration-toolkit/integrate#technical-integration-of-your-product) of your product. 

Any test data requests to support these scenarios can be requested via the [NHS login Developer Support Slack](https://nhs-login-support-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

## Vector of Trust check
We use a [Vector of Trust (VoT)](https://nhsconnect.github.io/nhslogin/vectors-of-trust/) check to ensure that the VoT that is sent in an authentication request by a supplier matches the one registered against the client ID.

If it does not match then the authentication request will be rejected.

Note: If you support more than one VoT, ensure you complete the test scenarios for each.
