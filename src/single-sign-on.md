title: Single Sign On (SSO)
---

NHS login supports Single Sign On (SSO) based on an asserted token exchange between two relying parties (RP1 & RP2).
- Asserted tokens are one time tokens (TTL 60 sec)
- Partner services can control who they share SSO with

NHS login supports two parameters `asserted_login_identity` and `prompt` as part of the OIDC flow. This allows for seamless login between two relying parties (RP1 and RP2).

Before partners are able to test SSO between two relying parties or even between the same party as part of an uplift journey, SSO configuration needs to be setup by NHS login.

To enable us to do this we will need to understand your SSO requirement as well as the client IDs being used. Please either send this information to the [Developer Support Slack](https://nhs-login-support-slack-invite.herokuapp.com) or by sending an email to [england.support.nhslogin@nhs.net](mailto:england.support.nhslogin@nhs.net).

## Technical details

Please refer to NHS login [external interface specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/nhslogin/interface-spec-doc/) for most up-to-date technical details.

### parameter: prompt

This is an optional parameter. It requests that NHS login forces the user to sign-in, or that the service does not prompt the user to sign-in (SSO).
 
| **Value** | **Description**                               |
| -------------|---------------------------------------------- |        
| `<blank>`    | The service will SSO the user if they still have a valid session, <br> otherwise the user will be requested to log in. |
| `"none"`     | The service will SSO the user if they still have a valid session, <br> otherwise an error code is returned. |
| `"login"`    | The service will request the user to log in, regardless of a session already existing. |

### parameter: asserted_login_identity

This is an optional parameter. It supports seamless login between two relying parties (RP1 and RP2) where cookie-based SSO is not available. 

The content will be a signed `jwt` with payload containing `“code”` attribute, with the value being that of the `jti` attribute from the ID Token issued to RP1. 

The `jwt` **MUST** 
- have an `“iss”` attribute that contains the `client_id` of RP1
- have an `"exp"` no longer than 60 seconds, 
- `“jti”` and `“iat”` attributes (as per RFC7519) 
- be signed by RP1 using its client private key. 

RP1 passes the `jwt` to RP2 for RP2 to use in its authentication request.

A non-normative example `jwt` payload section is as follows:

``` html
{
  code: “eeroifoteiwrudjdwusdu”,
  iss: “client1”,
  jti: “reioteotijdvorijevoihroi”,
  iat: 1548701645,
  exp: 1548701705
}
```

## SSO flow

### Step 1: login to RP1

User requests RP1 login - OIDC flow - Authorisation code flow

### Step 2: SSO from RP1 to RP2

User transitions from RP1 to RP2 - Single Sign On - Asserted token flow
