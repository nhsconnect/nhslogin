## Managing NHS login

NHS login provides capability for users to change their NHS login account settings online, help reducing calls into partner service support desks. 

To enable this, users must be logged into the partner service. The partner service needs to create a Single Sign On (SSO) link from their service to the NHS login settings page. Users must not need to re-authenticate to access the settings page.

- add and change mobile phone number
- add and change landline number
- set up a passkey
- remove a passkey

### Higher level verification (P9) access allows users to:
- update email address in Personal Demographics Service (PDS)
