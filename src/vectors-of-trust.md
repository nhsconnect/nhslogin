title: Introduction to Vectors of Trust
---

Vectors of Trust [(VoT RFC 8485)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8485) allows you to request the level of authentication and identity verification users need to access your service. This will be determined by the transactions the user carries out in your service.

Your service should include a vector value in the query string as part of the initialisation of the OIDC flow.

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
  <p>A partner must specify the minimum authentication requirements in line with the required verification levels.</p>
  <p>We recommend using Medium or High authentication to make sure users can login.</p>
</div>

## Authentication credentials

NHS login supports the following types of authentication credentials. Note that the credential component may occur more than once.

<div class="nhsuk-warning-callout">
  <h3 class="nhsuk-warning-callout__label">
    Important<span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">:</span>
  </h3>
  <p>If you do not provide the right level of authentication for your service, or you fail to specify a query string, the user may need to sign-in via NHS login to meet the required level.</p>

## Identity verification levels

The NHS login supports the following levels of identification verification. These are based upon [DCB3051 Identity Verification and
Authentication Standard for Digital Health and Care Services](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb3051-identity-verification-and-authentication-standard-for-digital-health-and-care-services).

## Requesting Vectors of Trust values

The client **may** request a set of acceptable VoT values with the "vtr" (vector of trust request) claim request as part of the Authentication Request. The value of this field is an array of JSON strings, each string identifying an acceptable set of vector components.

The component values within each vector are ANDed together while the separate vectors are ORed together. For example, a list of vectors in the form `["P9.Cp.Cd ", "P9.Cm"]` is stating that either the full set of "P9 AND Cp AND Cd" simultaneously OR the full set of "P9 AND Cm" simultaneously are acceptable for this transaction.

Vector request values **may** omit components, indicating that any value is acceptable for that component category, including omission of that component in the response vector.

Omission of vtr will result in a default value of `[“P9.Cp.Cd”,“P9.Cp.Ck”,“P9.Cm”]` being assumed.

---

## Returned Vectors of Trust values

The vector is sent as a string within the "vot" (vector of trust) claim in the ID and Access tokens. The trustmark that applies to this vector is sent as an HTTPS URL in the "vtm" (vector trust mark) claim to provide context to the vector.

For example, part of the body of an ID token claiming "Medium IDV, authenticated user via password and registered device identifier" will look like this JSON object payload of the ID token.

``` html
{
   "iss": "https://auth.login.nhs.uk/",
   "vot": "P5.Cp.Cd",
   "vtm": "https://auth.login.nhs.uk/trustmark/login.nhs.uk"
}
```

The body of the token is signed using JOSE, as per the OpenID Connect specification. By putting the "vot" and "vtm" values inside the token, the vector and its context are strongly bound to the federated credential represented by the token.

## Profiles

A profile is defined as the combination of Vectors of Trust that you can request in the vector of trust request (VTR). The NHS login profiles available for you to select are described below.

### Example 1: Partner service provides access to sensitive data

This example service requires high verification and strong authentication. 

The service sends the following as acceptable Vectors in the ‘vtr’ parameter:

`[“P9.Cp.Cd”,“P9.Cp.Ck”,“P9.Cm”]`

### Example 2: Partner service provides access to basic data (not sensitive)

This example service requires medium verification and strong authentication. 

The service sends the following as acceptable Vectors in the ‘vtr’ parameter:

`[“P5.Cp.Cd”,“P5.Cp.Ck”,“P5.Cm”]`

### Example 3: Partner service provides access to both basic data and sensitive data

This example maps onto a service offering multiple features, of which some require basic user data, and some require sensitive user data. The service requires medium verification and strong authentication.

The service sends the following as acceptable Vectors in the ‘vtr’ parameter:

`[“P5.Cp.Cd”,“P5.Cp.Ck”,“P5.Cm”,“P9.Cp.Cd”,“P9.Cp.Ck”,“P9.Cm”]`

A successfully authenticated user can be either medium or high level in terms of identity verification.

The service can offer all functionalities to a user that meets the service requirements of high verification and strong authentication. The service can only offer basic features to users with medium level verification at their initial login, as they meet the service requirements of medium verification and strong authentication only.

When a user with medium level verification attempts to access other features supported by sensitive data, the service then requires high verification and strong authentication (with Single Sign On allowed).

The service sends the following as acceptable Vectors in the ‘vtr’ parameter:

`[“P9.Cp.Cd”,“P9.Cp.Ck”,“P9.Cm”]` 

The user is prompted to undertake a verification step-up journey to take the user verification level from medium to high.

---

## Single sign-on (SSO)

If the user’s current session (if any) does not meet the requested Vectors of Trust (vtr) in the incoming request, then the user will be required to sign-in, to meet the requested vectors.

Also note that SSO behaviour, or to refuse SSO behaviour, can be controlled using the `prompt` parameter on the initial authorisation request.

---

## Trust mark

The trust mark provides a list of claims that NHS login supports. This enables the client to verify which components of a trust framework NHS login supports and hence their trustworthiness.

The NHS login trust mark is self-hosted.
