We provide support for developers through our public Slack workspace.

### Join our Slack workspace

To request access to Slack, email **england.support.nhslogin@nhs.net**

You can also request Slack access when you submit a request form for either the **Sandpit** or **Integration test** environment.

### Using Slack for support

Use Slack to get support with:
- onboarding and integration
- Sandpit and Integration test environments
- documentation and known issues

Slack does **not** provide support for live (production) issues.

For support after you go live, see
